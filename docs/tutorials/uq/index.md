# Understanding q


This introduces the deep structures of the q language.
It requires a more precise terminology than the [Walking Introduction](/tutorials/wi/). 

We need to speak of _maps_ where we were previously thinking only of functions. 
We need to pay careful attention to the rank of functions, and notice when a function’s rank is not fixed, i.e. it is ambivalent. 

You may wish to consult the [Glossary](/glossary/) for details of some of the terms here.
