  <title>Kdb+ and WebSockets</title>
  <para>
    Since the release of kdb+ 3.0, it has been possible to make use of
    <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</link>
    when connecting to a kdb+ process. This has significant implications
    for how we can build front-end applications that use a kdb+
    back-end, in particular for applications wanting to display
    real-time information.
  </para>
  <para>
    WebSockets are supported by most modern browsers and thus make it
    possible to hook a web application up directly to a kdb+ process to
    allow real-time communication over a persistent connection. This
    gives us the ability to build a pure HTML5 real-time web application
    which can connect to kdb+ through JavaScript, which is native to web
    browsers.
  </para>
  <para>
    Using web applications to build GUIs for kdb+ applications is
    becoming increasingly popular. Only a web browser is required to run
    the GUI, so it is OS independent. This means that when developing
    the GUI, only one codebase is required for all platforms and
    maintenance and upgrades are much easier and efficient to perform.
  </para>
  <para>
    This paper introduces what WebSockets are and what benefits they
    hold over standard HTTP. It takes the reader through the set-up of a
    simple web page that uses WebSockets to connect to a kdb+ process,
    the steps involved in passing data through the connection, and the
    various methods for converting data between kdb+ and JavaScript.
  </para>
  <para>
    An earlier version of this paper was published in October 2014. Kdb+
    has been enhanced since then to support the growing popularity of
    WebSockets and JSON. As part of this revision, the paper now also
    documents new message handlers for opening and closing WebSocket
    connections in section 3.3, and debugging techniques that can be
    used to view traffic over these connections in section 5.
  </para>
  <para>
    The paper finishes with a full working example (including code) of a
    simple Web application which uses kdb+ to provide real-time updating
    of tables based on user queries.

    <title>What are WebSockets?</title>
    <para>
      WebSockets were a long-awaited evolution in client and web server
      communication technology. They provide a protocol between a client
      and server which runs over a persistent TCP connection. The
      client-server connection can be kept open as long as needed and
      can be closed by either the client or the server. This open
      connection allows bi-directional, full-duplex messages to be sent
      over the single TCP socket connection â€“ the connection allows data
      transfer in both directions, and both client and server can send
      messages simultaneously. All messages sent across a WebSocket
      connection are asynchronous.
    </para>
    <para>
      Without WebSockets, bi-directional messaging can be forced by
      having distinct HTTP calls for both the client sending requests
      and the server publishing the responses and updates. This requires
      either the client to keep a mapping between outgoing and incoming
      messages, or the use of a proxy server in between the client and
      server (known as HTTP tunneling). WebSockets simplify this
      communication by providing a single connection which both client
      and server can send messages across.
    </para>
    <para>
      WebSockets were designed to be implemented in web browsers and web
      servers, but they can be used by any client or server application.
      The ability for bi-directional real-time functionality means it
      provides a basis for creating real-time applications on both web
      and mobile platforms. The WebSocket API and Protocol have both
      been standardized by W3C and the IEFT respectively.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="why-not-just-use-.z.ph">
      <title>Why not just use <literal>.z.ph</literal>?</title>
      <para>
        It has previously been possible to connect to a kdb+ process
        using HTTP. HTTP requests could be processed using the
        <literal>.z.ph</literal> and <literal>.z.pp</literal> handlers.
        To illustrate this, simply start up a q process with an open
        port and then type the hostname:port into your web browser. This
        will give a very basic view of the q process.
      </para>
      <para>
        Straight out of the box, this is very simple and provides a
        useful interface for viewing data and running basic queries
        without being limited to the character limits of a q console.
        If, however, you want to do more than just simple analysis on
        the q process, this method presents a few drawbacks:
      </para>
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Customization is quite a complicated process that requires
            you to manipulate the functions in the <literal>.h</literal>
            namespace which form the basis of the in-built HTTP server
            code. The HTML markup is generated entirely by the q
            process.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Data must be requested by the browser, so some form of
            polling must occur in order to update the webpage. This
            makes the viewing of real-time data impossible without the
            continuous polling of the kdb+ server.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <literal>.z.ph</literal> uses synchronous messaging, and the
            webpage is effectively refreshed every time a query is sent.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
        Instead of relying on <literal>.z.ph</literal> to serve the
        entire web page, an application could make use of AJAX
        techniques to send asynchronous GET and POST requests to a kdb+
        server. <literal>.z.ph</literal> and <literal>.z.pp</literal>
        can be modified to handle these requests. AJAX (Asynchronous
        JavaScript And XML) is a descriptive name that covers a range of
        web development techniques that can be used to provide
        asynchronous messaging between a web application and server.
      </para>
      <para>
        This allows requests to be made by the client in the background
        without having to reload the web page, and as there is no
        reliance on <literal>.z.ph</literal> to generate the HTML
        markup, the application can be fully customized independently of
        the kdb+ process. In order to receive updates, the application
        will still have to poll the server, which is not ideal for
        real-time data. The full implementation of this method is beyond
        the scope of this whitepaper.
      </para>
      <para>
        As WebSocket connections are persistent, the server is able to
        push updates to the client rather than relying on the client to
        poll for the information. Additionally, while each HTTP request
        and response must include a TCP header, WebSockets only require
        this header to be sent during the initial handshake.

      <title>The handshake</title>
      <para>
        In order to initialise a WebSocket connection, a WebSocket
        <quote>handshake</quote> must be successfully made between the
        client and server processes. First, the client sends a HTTP
        request to the server to upgrade from the HTTP protocol to the
        WebSocket protocol:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
// Client WebSocket request header&lt;/p&gt;
GET /text HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5001
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: xc0DPEL132mlMtGdbWJPGQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The server then sends a HTTP response indicating that the
        protocol upgrade was successful:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
// Server WebSocket response header
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: 1thgMROs9ylOWOMkc2WUWGRzWdY=
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The above handshake request and response details can be found
        within a browserâ€™s dev tools. Google Chromeâ€™s developer tools
        can be opened with the F12 key and any information on a pages
        network operations can found within its
        <emphasis>Network</emphasis> tab. Here you can click on
        <emphasis>WS</emphasis> to filter out just the WebSocket
        connections and then select a specific WebSocket connection to
        see a headers section detailing its request and response headers
        and perhaps, more importantly, see a <emphasis>Frames</emphasis>
        section which can be used to monitor traffic sent over the
        connection in real time. We will revisit the
        <emphasis>Frames</emphasis> section later.

    <section xml:id="z.ws-message-handler">
      <title><literal>.z.ws</literal> message handler</title>
      <para>
        Like the <literal>.z.ph</literal> HTTP GET handler, kdb+ has a
        separate message handler for WebSockets called
        <literal>.z.ws</literal>, meaning all incoming WebSocket
        messages will be processed by this function. There is no default
        definition of <literal>.z.ws</literal>; it should be customized
        by the developer to handle the incoming messages as required.
        Later, several examples of a customized <literal>.z.ws</literal>
        handler will be shown, but initially, we will look at a very
        basic definition:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="r script">
q).z.ws:{neg[.z.w].Q.s value x;}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        For now, letâ€™s assume that <literal>x</literal> (the query from
        the client) is being passed in as a string.
        <literal>value x</literal> simply evaluates the query, and
        passing this into <literal>.Q.s</literal> will present the
        result in console output format (i.e.Â plain text).
      </para>
      <para>
        As mentioned before, all messages passed through a WebSocket
        connection are asynchronous. This means that we must handle the
        server response within the <literal>.z.ws</literal> message
        handler. <literal>neg[.z.w]</literal> does this by
        asynchronously pushing the results back to the handle which
        raised the request.
      </para>
      <para>
        From the server side, using <literal>neg[.z.w]</literal> within
        the handler will push the result back to the client once it has
        been evaluated. The client does not wait for a response and
        instead the open WebSocket connection will receive the response
        some time later, so we must handle this on the client side as
        well.
      </para>
      <para>
        Fortunately, JavaScript has a native WebSocket API which allows
        us to handle this relatively easily. The main parts of the
        JavaScript API are explained below.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="html">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    function connect(){
        if (&quot;WebSocket&quot; in window){ // check if WebSockets supported
            // open a WebSocket
            var ws = new WebSocket(&quot;ws://host:port&quot;);
            ws.onopen = function(){
                // called upon successful WebSocket connection
            };
            ws.onmessage = function(msg){
                // called when the client receives a message
            };
            ws.onclose = function(){
                // called when WebSocket is closed
            };
        }
        else {
            // the browser doesn't support WebSockets
        }
    }
    ws.send(msg) // function to handle sending a message
&lt;/script&gt;

    <section xml:id="z.wo-and-.z.wc-message-handlers">
      <title><literal>.z.wo</literal> and <literal>.z.wc</literal>
      message handlers</title>
      <para>
        The <literal>.z.wo</literal> and <literal>.z.wc</literal>
        message handlers were introduced in kdb+ version 3.3
        (2014.11.26) to be evaluated whenever a WebSocket connection is
        opened (<literal>.z.wo</literal>) or closed
        (<literal>.z.wc</literal>). Prior to this version,
        <literal>.z.pc</literal> and <literal>.z.po</literal> provide an
        alternative solution however, these handle the opening and
        closing of all connections over a port and donâ€™t distinguish
        WebSocket connections.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>.z.wo</literal> handler, much like its
        <literal>.z.po</literal> counterpart, is called when the
        connection is initialized and after it has been validated
        against any <literal>-u</literal>/<literal>-U</literal> and/or
        <literal>.z.pw</literal> checks in place. Neither
        <literal>.z.wo</literal> nor <literal>.z.wc</literal> has a
        default definition, so they should be customized by the
        developer accordingly. Typical usage of these handlers is to
        maintain information on active WebSocket connections as
        demonstrated below:

        Here is an example of a simple client application connecting to

        version of the example in the Cookbook
        <link xlink:href="/cookbook/websockets">WebSocket
        article</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        First, start up a kdb+ server and set our
        <literal>.z.ws</literal> handler. Here we will also add some
        error trapping to the handler to send any error message to the
        client.

        file, which can then be read in any modern web browser.

      <para>
        In our HTML code, we define the elements that will capture input
        and display output, apply some basic stylings to those elements
        and supply the JavaScript that will send our input to the server
        and handle the response it gets back. This web application will
        function like a q console in that we can write some q commands
        in its input box, send that input as a string to the server by
        clicking a button and then see the returned result produced by
        the server evaluating those input commands.

        rather set up a subscription that continually pushes data
        through our WebSocket connection.
      </para>
      <para>
        As the WebSocket is persistent and obeys normal IPC protocol, we
        can push data through it asynchronously at any time using
        <literal>neg[h]</literal>, where <literal>h</literal> is the

      Converting kdb+ into string format using <literal>.Q.s</literal>
      means that not only is the message limited by the console size,

      that can be manipulated by the client.
    </para>
    <para>
      JavaScript has a built-in technology called JSON (JavaScript
      Object Notation) which can be used to create JavaScript objects in
      memory to store data. These objects are collections of name/value
      pairs which can be easily accessed by JavaScript and used to build
      the data structures displayed on the web page.
    </para>
    <para>
      We want to make use of JSON to hold our data so that we can easily
      display and manipulate our data on the client. There is a very
      important relationship between kdb+ and JSON â€“ kdb+ dictionaries
      and JSON objects are comparable. This means that we can parse our
      kdb+ data into JSON structures very easily, with tables just
      becoming arrays of JSON objects.
    </para>
    <para>
      Depending on the application, it may be of benefit to do this
      conversion on the server side within the q process, or on the

        Here is an example of how we can use this to manipulate data in
        our web app. First set up our server and use
        <literal>.j.j</literal> to convert the kdb+ output to JSON:

      <programlisting language="r script">

      <para>
        <link linkend="zws-message-handler">Above</link> we used the
        <literal>SimpleDemo.html</literal> file given in
        <link linkend="a-simpledemohtml">Appendix A</link>, which
        includes some code to handle a plain-text response and append it
        to the screen:

ws.onmessage=function(e){
    /*

        and '\n' to '&lt;br /&gt;' in order to display spaces and newlines correctly 
        within the HTML markup
    */
    var formattedResponse = e.data.replace(/ /g, '&amp;nbsp').replace(/\n/g, '&lt;br /&gt;');
    output.innerHTML = cmd + formattedResponse + output.innerHTML;
    cmd=&quot;&quot;;
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can now rewrite the <literal>ws.onmessage</literal>
        JavaScript function from this example to handle the messages
        coming through as JSON strings rather than just plain text.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="javascript">
ws.onmessage=function(e){
    /*parse the JSON string into a JSON object using JSON.parse */
    var outputHTML,data = JSON.parse(e.data);
    if (typeof data == &quot;object&quot;) {
        /* if an object, then message must be a table or a dictionary */
        if (data.length) {
            /*if object has a length then it is a table*/
            outputHTML = generateTableHTML(data);

    output.innerHTML = cmd + outputHTML + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot; + output.innerHTML;
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Whenever we handle a table in this example you will notice we
        call a function named <literal>generateHTML</literal>. This is a
        simple function we wrote to loop over each object in the array
        of objects that we now know represents a table and wrap each
        inner value in HTML table markup. This is in a separate function
        because we will reuse this functionality later and having it in
        a separate function makes it easier to copy and reuse in other
        applications.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="javascript">
function generateTableHTML(data){
    /* we will iterate through the object wrapping it in the HTML table tags */

        /* loop through the keys to create the table headers */
        tableHTML += '&lt;th&gt;' + x + '&lt;/th&gt;';
    }
    tableHTML += '&lt;/tr&gt;';
    for (var i = 0 i &lt; data.length; i++) {
        /* loop through the rows, putting tags around each col value */
        tableHTML += '&lt;tr&gt;';
        for (var x in data[0]) {

    }
    tableHTML += '&lt;/table&gt;';
    return tableHTML;
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        With our improvements in place, you can see that it gives the
        same web console application as before. The distinction,
        however, is that we are now handling JSON objects which are
        easier to manipulate than strings of plain text. The JavaScript
        code will now be aware of data type information which is not the
        case with plain strings and could use that information to
        perform more complex operations like filtering data or
        populating charts.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using the <literal>.j</literal> functions within the q process
        is very straightforward, and if it is suitable for the
        application to transfer messages across the WebSocket as
        strings, this can be a good solution. However, in some cases, it
        may be preferable to serialize the data into binary format
        before transmitting it across the connection.

      <title>Using <literal>c.js</literal> within JavaScript
      (client-side parsing)</title>
      <para>
        Instead of parsing the data within the kdb+ server using
        <literal>.j</literal> functions, we could instead use
        <literal>-8!</literal> to serialize the data into kdb+ binary
        form and then deserialize it on the client side directly into a
        JSON object. With client machines generally being a lot more
        powerful than in the past, it is reasonable to provide the
        client-side JavaScript code with some extra workload.
      </para>
      <para>
        This approach requires a little more understanding of
        JavaScript. However, Kx provides the script
        <literal>c.js</literal> which contains the functionality to
        serialize and deserialize data on the client side. The
        deserialize function converts kdb+ binary data into JSON, while
        the serialize function will convert our message into kdb+ binary
        format before sending it to the server. <literal>c.js</literal>
        can be found on GitHub at: <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/c/c.js">KxSystems/kdb/c/c.js</link>
      </para>
      <para>
        The previous section showed how we can parse q structures into
        JSON strings and send them to our client. In this example, we
        will instead do all of the parsing on the client side to produce
        the same result. The client will send strings to the server, but
        the server will send serialized data back to the client.
        Outgoing messages are serialized using the
        <literal>-8!</literal> operator:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="r script">
q)\p 5001
q).z.ws:{neg[.z.w] -8! @[value;x;{`$&quot;'&quot;,x}]}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We need to make a few adjustments to our JavaScript code in
        order to handle the serialized responses. Firstly, we need to
        load the <literal>c.js</literal> script into our web page by
        downloading the <literal>c.js</literal> file to the same
        directory as our HTML document, and include the below import
        just before our main set of <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal>
        tags.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="html">
&lt;script src=&quot;c.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        When we define our WebSocket connection, we need to tell the
        JavaScript code to expect the messages to be coming through in
        binary. For this we set <literal>ws.binaryType</literal> to
        <literal>'arraybuffer'</literal>. Place this line on the line
        after we have set up the new WebSocket connection.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="javascript">
ws = new WebSocket(&quot;ws://localhost:5001/&quot;);
ws.binaryType = 'arraybuffer';
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Next, we need to edit the <literal>ws.onmessage</literal>
        function. As we are deserializing the message straight into
        JSON, we do not need to use the <literal>JSON.parse</literal>
        function. Instead, we simply replace it with the deserialize
        function provided in <literal>c.js</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="javascript">
var outputHTML,data = deserialize(e.data);
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The rest of <literal>ws.onmessage</literal> should be identical
        to the example in the previous section and should work exactly
        as it did before. We could also decide we want to serialize the
        message that we send to the server from the client using the
        serialize function.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="javascript">
ws.send(serialize(input.value)); 
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This would then require that we update <literal>.z.ws</literal>
        to deserialize the message back into a string using
        <literal>-9!</literal> so that it can then be evaluated.

    <title>Viewing traffic over a WebSocket connection</title>
    <para>
      When working with WebSockets sometimes we may need to view the
      messages that are being sent over a WebSocket connection for
      debugging purposes. We can do this by inspecting the
      <emphasis>Network</emphasis> tab in our browserâ€™s developer tools.
      We are going to use Google Chrome for the demonstration of this,
      but most modern browsers will also implement similar
      network-monitoring tools.
    </para>
    <para>
      In <link linkend="the-handshake">The handshake</link>, we looked
      at the headers associated with a WebSocket connection. Beside the
      <emphasis>Headers</emphasis> section, there is a
      <emphasis>Frames</emphasis> tab that displays what messages have
      been sent and received, the time they happened, and how many
      characters long those messages were. The figure below shows us the
      traffic conducted while using our earlier web console application.

      You can see above that the messages in green are query strings
      that we are sending to the server and the messages in white are
      the JSON strings we are getting back. The last line shows us a
      different response from the server. At this point, the
      <literal>.z.ws</literal> message handler was modified slightly.
      Instead of using <literal>.j.j</literal> before sending back the
      data, it was changed to serialize it using <literal>-8!</literal>
      instead. The binary frame that we see is simply the serialized
      response we are getting back. It is important to note when sending
      serialized data we cannot view the message again until it has been
      received and deserialized.

      The methods used to protect kdb+ processes can be extended to
      cover WebSockets. There is one caveat in terms of

        Client authentication is not defined in the WebSocket protocol,
        and in most cases, it is up to the developer to implement an
        authentication method of their choice. This means that being
        prompted for a username and password by the browser when the

        browsers, Chrome and Firefox do support this, however.

        If we try to connect to the process using Chrome or Firefox,
        they will prompt for a username and password and, upon correct
        entry, successfully create the connection. Not all browsers will
        currently ask for authentication details, and if so their
        connection attempt will not be successful. When the connection
        is not successful due to authentication, a response code of 401
        (unauthorized) will be returned to the client.
      </para>
      <para>
        Behind the scenes, Chrome/Firefox are actually sending two
        requests. When they each receive the first 401 response code,
        they prompt for a username and password and then send a new
        WebSocket request with an additional
        <quote>Authorization</quote> option in the header.

      <para>
        As mentioned <link linkend="zws-message-handler">above</link>,
        all WebSocket messages will be processed by the
        <literal>.z.ws</literal> handler. To fully secure a kdb+ system,
        this handler should be locked down in the same manner as the

      instructions in order to get the example working. Some of the key

      the ability to filter the syms in view</emphasis></small>
    </para>
    <para>
      The idea behind the pubsub mechanism here is that a client will
      make subscriptions to specific functions and provide parameters
      that they should be executed with. The subscription messages we
      send to the server will be sent as query strings so our
      <literal>.z.ws</literal> message handler is defined to simply
      evaluate them.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="r script">
q).z.ws:{value x}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Next, we initialize the trade and quote tables and
      <literal>upd</literal> function to mimic a simple Real-Time
      Subscriber, along with a further table called
      <literal>subs</literal>, which we will use to keep track of
      subscriptions.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="r script">
// subs table to keep track of current subscriptions
q)subs:2!flip `handle`func`params`curData!&quot;is**&quot;$\:()
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>subs</literal> table will store the handle, function
      name and function parameters for each client. As we only want to
      send updates to a subscriber when something has changed, we store
      the current data held by each subscriber so that we can compare
      against it later.
    </para>
    <para>
      The functions that can be called and subscribed to by clients
      through the WebSocket should be defined as necessary. In this
      example, we have defined a simple function that will return a list
      of distinct syms that will be used to generate the filter
      checkboxes on the client and additional functions to display the
      last record for each sym in both the trade and quote tables. The
      aforementioned trade and quote table functions will also accept an
      argument by which to filter the data if it is present.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="r script">
//subscribe to something
sub:{`subs upsert(.z.w;x;enlist y)}
//publish data according to subs table
pub:{
  row:(0!subs)[x];
  (neg row[`handle]) .j.j (value row[`func])[row[`params]]
  }
// trigger refresh every 1000ms
.z.ts:{pub each til count subs}
\t 1000
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The subfunction will handle new subscriptions by upserting the
      handle, function name and function parameters into the
      <literal>subs</literal> table. <literal>.z.wc</literal> will
      handle removing subscriptions from the table whenever a connection
      is dropped.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>pub</literal> function is responsible for publishing
      data to the client. It takes an argument that refers to a row
      index in the <literal>subs</literal> table and uses it to get the
      subscriptions function, the parameters to use when calling that
      function and the handle that it will use in sending the result to
      the client. Before doing so, it will also use
      <literal>.j.j</literal> to parse the result into a JSON string.
      The client can then parse the JSON into a JavaScript object upon
      arrival as it did in the earlier example. The
      <literal>pub</literal> function itself will be called on a timer
      every second for each row in the <literal>subs</literal> table.
    </para>
    <para>
      One thing that is important to be consider whenever using
      WebSockets is that the JavaScript <literal>onmessage</literal>
      function needs a way in which to identify different responses from
      one another. Each different response could have a different data
      structure that will need to be handled differently. Perhaps some
      data should be used in populating charts while other data for
      updating a table. If an identifier is present, it can be used to
      ensure each response is handled accordingly. In this example, the
      responses <literal>func</literal> value acts as our identifier. We
      can look at the <literal>func</literal> value and from that
      determine which function should be called in order to handle the
      associated data.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="javascript">
ws.onmessage = function(e) {
    /*parse message from JSON String into Object*/
    var d = JSON.parse(e.data);
    /*
        depending on the messages func value, 
        pass the result to the appropriate handler function
    */
    switch(d.func){
        case 'getSyms'   : setSyms(d.result);   break;
        case 'getQuotes' : setQuotes(d.result); break;
        case 'getTrades' : setTrades(d.result);
    }
};
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The rest of the JavaScript code for the client has been seen in
      previous examples. The tables that update in the browser are
      simply being redrawn every time the client receives a new response
      for the appropriate table.

    <para>
      The end result is a simplistic, interactive, real-time web

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>
      This whitepaper has shown how WebSockets can be used as part of a

      real-time communication between kdb+ and a web browser.

    <para>
      There are different methods for sending messages over the
      connection, and we have seen how to parse kdb+ data into JSON
      objects using both server-side and client-side methods. Both of
      these methods have their benefits and drawbacks so it is important
      to consider the application infrastructure when deciding which
      method will be most suitable. Serialising data across the
      connection is easy to achieve using the <literal>-8!</literal> and
      <literal>-9!</literal> functions on the kdb+ server and the
      <literal>c.js</literal> code provided by Kx on the JavaScript
      client. Alternatively, the kdb+ <literal>.j.j</literal> and
      <literal>.j.k</literal> functions can be used in conjunction with
      a browserâ€™s native JSON parser to achieve the same result.
