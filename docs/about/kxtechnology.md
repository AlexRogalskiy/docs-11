The Kx technology consists of:

-   kdb+ – the database
-   q – an analytic and query language for kdb+ users
-   k – the programming language used to implement both kdb+ and q

This site documents q – the main language for working with kdb+.

The kdb+ database and q language were introduced in 2003 as part of a 64-bit rewrite of the earlier kdb database. The underlying k language and databases have been developed since 1993.

The q programming language evolved from its ancestor languages APL, J and k.
