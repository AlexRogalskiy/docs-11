Documentation for kdb+and q
===========================



Version 2.0 of the documentation site at [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com).



## Platform

This site is generated with the [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org/) static-site generator, with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. 


## Local copy

If your Net connection is slow, you might prefer to download the site for local use from [code.kx.com/site.zip](http://code.kx.com/site.zip). 


## Q for Mortals V3

Unlike the first two editions, _Q for Mortals V3_ is now published in its entirety [online in HTML](https://code.kx.com/q4m3). 

Links from the Reference and Cookbook to _Q for Mortals_ have been replaced with links to _Q for Mortals V3_.


## Not upwardly compatible 

Version 2.0 substantially reorganizes the URL structure of the site. 
Most keywords and operators now have short URLs, e.g. code.kx.com/v2/ref/aj and code.kx.com/v2/ref/fill. 

The terminology revision begun in Version 1.0 is completed: _adverbs_ are now _iterators_. The Reference material for them has been completely rewritten and the 2013 whitepaper “Efficient use of adverbs” re-issued as [“Iterators”](https://code.kx.com/v2/wp/iterators/). The concept of _rank_ is extended from functions to all applicable values. _Variadic_ replaces _ambivalent_ for values (e.g. derived functions and matrixes) that may be applied as either unary or binary. 

The Cookbook articles are now in the [Knowledge Base](https://code.kx.com/kb/).

Rewriting the Reference material required settling the [vocabulary](http://code.kx.com/basics/glossary) in which q is described.
