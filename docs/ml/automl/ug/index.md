# :fontawesome-solid-share-alt: Overview - Code infrastructure and interacting with the Kx AutoML framework

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/automl](https://github.com/kxsystems/automl)

The documentation presented for this framework provides a number of entry points for users who wish to interact with the AutoML framework

1. Users wishing to use the interface without need for detailed information on the implementation can use the [User-callable functions](functions.md) section of the documentation.
2. Users who require a low level introduction to the procedures being undertaken within the framework can find this information in 3 sections dedicated to the core elements of most machine learning workflows.
	1. [Data pre-processing](preproc.md) (data retrieval, data cleaning, feature extraction)
	2. [Data processing](proc.md) (model selection and optimization)
	3. [Data post-processing](postproc.md) (saving reports, models, graphs and metadata)
3. Users who need to make changes to the underlying functionality by changing tunable parameters can find this information in the [Advanced parameter modifications](advanced.md) section.
