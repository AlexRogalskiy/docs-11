# <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Calling Python from q (embedPy)

The embedPy library opens [Python](https://python.org) to q programmers. This is achieved by loading Python into kdb+ via a C api.

As a result Python variables or objects become q variables or objects and both languages can interact with them. Python code can be embeded within q code, and Python functions can be called as q functions acting on q data. 

A full outline of the available functionality and installation instructions can be foundin the machine learning section of this website at the link below.
