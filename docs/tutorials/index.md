# Learning the city

Learning a new language is a lot like getting to know a new city.
Walking around is the best way to begin. 
Preferably with people who live there.
They will show you what you most need to know. 

For a short stay, perhaps a business trip, that might be all you need.
Some shopping, some sights, a walk in the park. 
Back to the airport. Job done. 

You can learn a huge amount about a city just by walking around and keeping your eyes open. 
(Dickens, Balzac, and Hugo were all great walkers.) 
Many of us know our own cities the same way. 
We know how to get to work, to entertainment, the business district, to shops.
To our friends. It’s enough.

You can learn just about everything you need to know about kdb+ in a similar manner: reading examples, asking others to show you around, trying things for yourself. 
You can learn everything you need to know – eventually. 

But if you want to build in the city – if you want to be a _developer_ – you need to know it in a different way.
You need to know how the utility grids work, and where they are. 
The transport networks. 
You need to know the geology. Where the water table is.
What you can build on, where you can dig. 

You need to know what choices you have. 

So we offer several guides to kdb+ and q:

-   [**A Walking Introduction to kdb+**](wi/) will get you started. You’ll get some basic things done, find your way around the references, and start exploring by yourself. 
-   [**_Q for Mortals_**](http://code.kx.com/q4m3) is the ultimate insider’s walking tour, with extended examples. Particularly good on qSQL. Now in its third edition.
-   [**Understanding q**](uq/) is a deep look at the language. Beneath some deceptively simple surface structures lie the great engines of q, such as Amend, Query, Apply, Index, and the adverbs. The abstraction and generality of these ‘leviathans of the deep’ underwrite kdb+’s speed and power. Master and ride them.
-   [**A Survey of kdb+**](survey) is a quick look around. If you know cities, what you need to know about San Francisco is that it is a port, has earthquakes – and some genius laid a street grid over the hills, so there are grades. This is a survey of what’s distinctive about kdb+. 
-   The ~~White Book of Newry~~ [**White Papers**](/wp) describe solutions to development problems, with an emphasis on architecture.
-   [**The Knowledge**](kb/) is what London cab drivers call the navigation skills that enable them to ‘solve’ any route across the city. Our Knowledge Base is a collection of problems solved.
