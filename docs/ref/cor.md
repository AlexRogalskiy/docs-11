# `cor`



_Correlation_

```txt
x cor y    cor[x;y]
```

Where `x` an d `y` are conforming numeric lists returns their correlation as a floating point number in the range `-1f` to `1f`. Applies to all numeric data types and signals an error with temporal types, char and sym.

```q
q)29 10 54 cor 1 3 9
0.7727746
q)10 29 54 cor 1 3 9
0.9795734
q)1 3 9 cor neg 1 3 9
-1f

q)select price cor size by sym from trade
```

`cor` is an aggregate function.

The function `cor` is equivalent to `{cov[x;y]%dev[x]*dev y}`.

Perfectly correlated data results in a `1` or `-1`. When one variable increases as the other increases the correlation is positive; when one decreases as the other increases it is negative. 

Completely uncorrelated arguments return `0f`.
